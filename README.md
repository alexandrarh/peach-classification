# Peach classification
Trying to practice more on my ML skills outside of classes by doing image classifications on cat pictures, and trying to classify Peach and Not Peach cats. Used tutorial provided by [Dilith Jayakody](https://dilithjay.com/blog/custom-image-classifier-with-pytorch#2-define-the-datasets-and-dataloaders) to help do image classification.
